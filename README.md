House Prediction using Linear Regression and Wine Quality Detection
Introduction
This repository contains two machine learning projects: House Prediction using Linear Regression and Wine Quality Detection. These projects were contributed by Neeraj Gupta to showcase the use of linear regression for house price prediction and wine quality classification.

House Prediction using Linear Regression
Overview
The House Prediction project demonstrates the use of linear regression to predict house prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and neighborhood.

Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine:

shell
Copy code
git clone [https://github.com/neerajgupta2407/house-prediction.git](https://github.com/NeerajGupta35483/Bharat_ml/blob/main/House_prediction.ipynb)
Navigate to the house-prediction directory:

shell
Copy code
cd house-prediction
Install the required Python packages:

shell
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter Notebook:

shell
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Open the House_Prediction.ipynb notebook to explore the code and run the linear regression model for house price prediction.

Wine Quality Detection
Overview
The Wine Quality Detection project focuses on classifying wine quality as either "good" or "bad" based on various chemical properties of the wine, such as acidity, alcohol content, and density.

Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine (if you haven't already):

shell
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/neerajgupta2407/wine-quality-detection.git
Navigate to the wine-quality-detection directory:

shell
Copy code
cd wine-quality-detection
Install the required Python packages:

shell
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter Notebook:

shell
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Open the Wine_Quality_Detection.ipynb notebook to explore the code and run the wine quality classification model.
